Simple Port Scanner that i made :D


# Step 1: Setup:

#1 - Download Python https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.1/python-3.9.1-amd64.exe

#2 - Download PIP https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/

#3 - Download Termcolor - (run command in cmd) pip install termcolor

### You're Done! :D


# Step 2: Running the Program:

#1 - Open The File( I'm Assuming You Know How To Open A File xD)

#2 - Enter The Targets (split the targets by ,)

#3 - Select How Many Ports You Want To Scan (1-65535)

### Thats all :DD

# PS:
The Program Is Printing Only Open Ports, That's Mean If The Target Has Not Any Open The Ports, U Will Not See Anything.
